⭐ Final Project – Console Dodge Game

Welcome to my first-ever programming project!
This game was created as my final project for Programming 1, and it represents my very first attempt at making a complete game from scratch using C# and the Console.
Even though it’s simple (and sometimes a little laggy), I'm proud of it and what I learned while building it.

🎮 Game Description
This is a fast-paced console game where the player must:
Avoid moving enemies
Collect coins to increase their score
Grab time bonuses to reduce the timer
Look out for special bonuses that can help—or surprise—you
Reach the target score (10 or 15 depending on difficulty)
All before the timer reaches 20 seconds
Enemies, coins, time reductions, and bonuses all appear directly inside the console window, and the player moves around using the arrow keys.

📘 Context & Purpose

This game was created:
As the final project for Programming 1
To demonstrate basic understanding of:
Arrays
Classes and objects
Random number generation
Console drawing and movement
User input handling
Basic game loops and game states

It’s my first real game, built without external frameworks—just pure C# logic and the console.

✨ Features

Player movement with arrow keys
Four difficulty levels (Easy → Extreme)
Increasing numbers of enemies based on difficulty

Randomized:
Enemy movement
Coin placement
Time bonuses
Special bonus effects

Special bonuses include:
Time freeze
Extra score
Temporary invincibility

A simple menu system (Start, Goal, Controls)
Countdown-style timer system
Win/lose screens



🛠️ Technologies Used
C#
.NET Console
Basic object-oriented programming (OOP)
Random number generation
Console cursor manipulation

🚀 How to Run
Open the project in Visual Studio or another C# IDE
Build & run the solution
Use the menu to start the game and pick a difficulty
Move the player using the arrow keys
Try to reach the score goal before the timer hits 20!

🎉 Final Notes

This project represents the start of my journey in programming and game development.
Although simple and sometimes imperfect, it taught me a lot about problem-solving, debugging, and structuring code.
Hope you enjoy trying it out! If I ever remake it, I’ll definitely improve the performance and add smoother gameplay.
